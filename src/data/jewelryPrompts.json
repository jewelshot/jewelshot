    "prompt": "Professional jewelry photography with the EXACT jewelry piece from input image worn on live model. CRITICAL: Keep the original jewelry exactly as provided - same design, same gemstones, same metal. Do not add any other jewelry pieces. Model wears ONLY this one piece of jewelry. Place jewelry naturally and ensure proper fit: RING must fit snugly on finger at proper size (not loose, not sliding off, sits firmly at finger base), NECKLACE must rest naturally on neck/collarbone area at appropriate length (not hanging too low, not too tight, sits elegantly at proper chain length), EARRING must appear properly attached to ear (not floating, positioned correctly on earlobe or ear), BRACELET must fit properly on wrist (not too loose, not sliding down hand, rests naturally on wrist). Jewelry should look realistically worn with natural weight and drape. Model wearing appropriate clothing for jewelry type: if NECKLACE then elegant V-neck or scoop neck top in solid color (white, beige, cream, or soft gray) showing decolletage and neck area clearly, if EARRING then off-shoulder or simple tank top showing neck and shoulders, if RING or BRACELET then simple sleeveless or short-sleeve top. Clothing must be minimal, elegant, and appropriate to showcase the specific jewelry piece without covering it. Clean neutral studio background (soft gray or warm beige). Soft natural studio lighting. Focus on jewelry in sharp detail. Model's hands or face elegantly positioned to showcase the jewelry. Minimal makeup, natural refined pose. Show jewelry scale and wearability with realistic fit. IMPORTANT: Only ONE piece of jewelry visible - the one from input. Model wears no other accessories, no watches, no other rings, no other necklaces. Clean minimal styling.

CRITICAL: Keep the original jewelry exactly as provided - same design, same gemstones, same metal. Do not add any other jewelry pieces. Display ONLY this one piece of jewelry in the composition. Jewelry must be the largest and most prominent element in the frame - clearly visible and unmissable. Use MINIMAL subtle decorative elements in the far background - one or two small elements like a marble edge, soft fabric texture, or single dried botanical kept out of focus and secondary. Background elements should be blurred and understated to avoid competing with jewelry. Strong directional lighting focused primarily on the jewelry piece to make it stand out. Jewelry positioned in the foreground with sharp focus: ring elevated on minimal platform, necklace draped elegantly in center, earrings with clear spacing and prominence. Background kept simple and muted (soft earth tones, monochromatic palette). Large negative space around jewelry. Clean elegant composition where jewelry dominates at least 40-50% of the frame. IMPORTANT: Jewelry is the star - decorative elements are minimal, blurred, and in background only. No additional jewelry, no other rings, no other necklaces. No cluttered composition. No text, no words, no letters.",
