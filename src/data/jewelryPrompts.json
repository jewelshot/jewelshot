CRITICAL: Keep the original jewelry exactly as provided - same design, same gemstones, same metal. Do not add any other jewelry pieces. Display ONLY this one piece of jewelry in the composition. Jewelry must be the largest and most prominent element in the frame - clearly visible and unmissable. Use MINIMAL subtle decorative elements in the far background - one or two small elements like a marble edge, soft fabric texture, or single dried botanical kept out of focus and secondary. Background elements should be blurred and understated to avoid competing with jewelry. Strong directional lighting focused primarily on the jewelry piece to make it stand out. Jewelry positioned in the foreground with sharp focus: ring elevated on minimal platform, necklace draped elegantly in center, earrings with clear spacing and prominence. Background kept simple and muted (soft earth tones, monochromatic palette). Large negative space around jewelry. Clean elegant composition where jewelry dominates at least 40-50% of the frame. IMPORTANT: Jewelry is the star - decorative elements are minimal, blurred, and in background only. No additional jewelry, no other rings, no other necklaces. No cluttered composition. No text, no words, no letters.",
